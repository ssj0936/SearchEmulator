# SearchEmulator
A path search emulator inspired by my failed Google interview experience. Implementation of MVI architecture using Android compose, Flow, Coroutine, Hilt.

## How to play it :
This project is like those Leetcode graph problems, finding a path from a given point. 
* You start from **green** block and the destination is **yellow** block. 
* You can draw some **barrier** to preventing stepping into these blocks.
* You can choose some differents travelsal/searching algo. to see how they work and the animated process.
* You can pause, restart, stop, event speed up / slow down the speed of process animation at anytime.

## How it work

## Some difficult part:

## To-do
* Random generated maze
* Landscape layout
* Algo. explain section (maybe present in side drawer)
* More Algo options
* 2 start points and 2 end points (exactly what I be asked in interview)
* Beautify UI
